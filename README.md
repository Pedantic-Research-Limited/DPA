Detached Point arithmitic 

 Placeholder for proper readme

core concept is easy seperate the dot from the math.
    this doesnt replace all math is't not a fix everything and it's not ment to be a standard
    groups make standards, i'm just a guy..

    but for things with known/fix bounds it does a fairly good job sofar

    I came up with this idea to get better DSP on a 2040 that has no FP unit
    so much of my work on this will be aimed at the hardware side of things where FP is not an option or not enought on it's      own w/ whats available to work with
